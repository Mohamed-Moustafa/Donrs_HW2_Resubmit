my task consists of 4 matlab files

Kuka_FK.m --> this to view syms Forward Kinematics

Kuka_Fk_fn.m ---> this the function of forward kinematics takes q 1x6 array as input and return H of endeffector

Kuka_IK_fn.m ---> this the function of Inverse Kinematics takes H of pose and orientation we want and return 8 different joint angles configuration that must be applied taking into consideration singularities , joints limits , workspace limitations
